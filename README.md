# MonteCarloMethodsStats
Repository for Monte Carlo Methods in Statistics -- includes code for sampling (rejection, metropolis-hastings, Gibbs) and for Bayesian inference + model selection

This repository serves as a personal reference for the SDS386D: Monte Carlo Methods In Statistics course at UT Austin

### Overview
  * Assignment 1: rejection sampling, importance sampling
  * Assignment 2: evaluates an integral using a Gauss-Markov process by exploiting the similarity of the integral with E[f(X)] where X~N(0,1) and showing that the Markov chain corresponds to repetitive sampling of a standard normal
  * Assignment 3: MCMC, Metropolis-Hastings, Bayesian inference
  * Assignment 4: Gibbs sampling, expected value from the predictive density, use of latent variables, Bayesian inference
  * Assignment 5: mixture model, Dirichlet prior, use of latent variables, Gibbs sampling with a Metropolis step
  * Assignment 6: sequential Monte Carlo: Kalman filter, particle filter
  * midterm: data augmentation via slice sampling, Bayesian inference, Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling with a Metropolis step
  * final: Bayesian model selection
